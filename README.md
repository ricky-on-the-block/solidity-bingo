# Solidity Bingo

Solidity Bingo is an educational project demonstrating the application of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) in iteratively developing a complex Solidity project. This project showcases how to build a decentralized Bingo game on the EVM, starting from feature specifications and progressing through multiple development phases.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to illustrate best practices in smart contract development, including:

- Iterative development using BDD
- Gradual feature implementation
- Code optimization
- Scalability considerations

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- Basic game functionality
- Single game per contract
- Fixed number of players and game cost
- Optimized for gas efficiency
- Simplified Random Number Generator (RNG) for testing

### Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality

- Bingo Boards implemented as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
- Support for multiple concurrent games
- Variable player count and betting amounts

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

(To be defined based on project progress and community feedback)

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Implementation

(To be defined based on project progress and community feedback)

## Key Features

- Smart contract-based Bingo game
- Transparent and verifiable gameplay
- Scalable architecture for future enhancements
